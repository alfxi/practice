# practice
1. Removed spaces between annotations and method's defines. 
2. Variables containing whole numbers are now using Integer class instead of int class.
3. Comments are now written using /**...*/ for documentation function of IntelliJ IDEA
4. Swagger documentation added, available at localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
